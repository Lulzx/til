# Github Actions

The README.md of this repository is automatically generated using GitHub Actions. The script can be found [here](https://github.com/Lulzx/til/blob/master/.github/workflows/generate-readme.yml) and the results page can be found [here](https://github.com/lulzx/til/actions).

This means that now we can just press the "Create file" button, dirrectly in the GitHub interface, no need to clone, and the README index will always be up to date.
